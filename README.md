# ML-1: Standardization, Classification & Model evaluation

Homework 3: Are you mad enough to sell more clothes?

Overview
The data set is from a fairly high end clothing chain store in the North East. You should be familiar with this data from Exercise 3 where you learnt about feature engineering.
You are a data analyst for this store. Your job is to write a report to the pointy-haired boss in which you show how you can increase the store's profit by targeting whom to send a catalog in the mail. Yes, you are in direct marketing. You are a quant amongst the "mad men".
You need to explore and layout in simple terms, what the business needs to spend to increase its profit. In other words, you need a budget, and its your job to figure out how much as well.
We'll guide you through the process. There is much more you can explore, of-course, but this homework will walk you through an entire real world classification and analysis process with a finite amount of work and computer runtime.
You will
learn how to standardize the data
write a classifier on this data, including cross validation
learn how to compare this classifier to baseline classifiers that you better beat using a profit metric rather than an accuracy metric
understand and use prediction thresholds
understand the use a ROC curve
learn to use a profit curve to pick a model, thus directly reflecting the metric of importance
You have been provided with the cleaned data after numerous feature transformations.
The idea for this homework, and the attendant data set is taken from the book "Data Mining Methods and Models" by Larose.
